# DevSearch website using python django
 'DevSearch' is a fully functioning website with multiple apps like 'projects', 'users' made under the guidance of Denis Ivanov's Python Django course on Udemy. Almost all backend work is done via the Django framework plus some JavaScript.
The frontend theme was installed as given as part of the course but before that all templates were hand-coded.
